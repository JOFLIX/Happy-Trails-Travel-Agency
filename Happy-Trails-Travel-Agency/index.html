        <strong>Svalbard</strong>
        DescriptionSvalbard is a Norwegian archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole.
        One of the world’s northernmost inhabited areas, it's known for its rugged, remote terrain of glaciers and frozen tundra sheltering polar bears, Svalbard reindeer and Arctic foxes.
        The Northern Lights are visible during winter, and summer brings the “midnight sun”—sunlight 24 hours a day.

    <h3 class="tropical">Tropical Destinations</h3>
      <p class="tropical">
        Strung across the Indian Ocean southwest of India and Sri Lanka, the 26 natural atolls of the Maldives exude an almost surreal beauty due, in large part, to the luminous blue waters that surround them.
        If slipping into the crystal-clear, soul-warming sea is a top criteria for your perfect tropical vacation, this is the place to do it, as water comprises 99 percent of the Maldives. Paradoxically,
        it also threatens to inundate the shores of this low-lying island nation.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
